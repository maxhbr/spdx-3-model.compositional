* An implementation of spdx-3-model

This repository implements the datamodel defined in [[https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model][spdx-3-model]].

** Just a POC
This is just a proof of concept and probably roughtly 80% complete, but it has the following features
- *a datamodel*, using GADTs
  - implementing "core" and "software" profile
- *complete serialization* to JSON
  - example outputs are written to =./_testOut/=
- *complete deserialization* from JSON
- *conversion* from SPDX 2.2 or 2.3 to 3.0
  - this uses [[https://github.com/maxhbr/spdx-tools-hs/][spdx-tools-hs]]
